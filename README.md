# Music-club

Official Android App for VIT Music Club to book music room, promote events, chat on community forums etc.
 
## Objectives - 
For the music club, it is a real headache to book the slots of the music room for practice sessions. The conventional method based on paper pen is really slow and very confusing. So we plan to make a smart platform that will allow user to book their slot online with the convenience. User will be able to see when and by whom the room is booked. User can add group members to the booking and can opt to notify them instantly via android notification. Group members can chat and discuss anything using the same app. There will be a separate tab dedicated for the promotion of upcoming club events. Each user has to authenticate themselves in the app to avail the features of the app. They can also maintain their user profile. There will also be a discussion forum where the music club members can discuss anything and everything. The messaging feature allows to interact personally or as a group. The user is not bound to only textual communication. User can use voice messages, emoticons, stickers and GIFs. There will also be the option to ask people what songs one should perform, user might post different songs and all the users can vote for which one they think the user should perform. There will also be a playlist of top songs for each week and month, all the users can vote for their favorites and accordingly a list will be generated. In the events tab the user can go through all the upcoming events user can select an event and like and comment. There will also be an AR aspect to this app. The user can scan the poster of different events and he/she will be given all the information about it, information include the links to all the social media pages, creating an event in the userâ€™s calendar app for the date and time mentioned on the poster, ask to call by getting number printed, and finally he will asked for feedback. Also, if the user is not a VITian then once he scans a poster, he/she will be asked that if wants to be notified for all the other future events that are upcoming.
